This is my version of the event board application.

I've tried to use as many techniques as i can not only on the back-end, but in the front-end also.




## Installation - Back-end

```
$> git clone https://github.com/EverML/backend-test
$> cd backend-test/app
$> npm i
$> npm install nodemon -g
$> npm install knex -g
$> npm run migrate
$> npm run seed
$> npm start

```
